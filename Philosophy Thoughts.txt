Currently, who you buy your cell phone from is basically The Tram Problem. You wind up getting someone killed for your electronics, 
you just need to pick who/where/how many should die. Or, not buy products from companies that monetarily support human rights violations.

And now, a tangent.
If we are to define our morality based on emotions or elements of our biology and experienced reality, we are still basing it on elements
that only apply to us as humans. This has problems when we apply it to far-future generations. What happens to morality if new characteristics
of humans evolve over time? Does the old morality still apply if we intentionally modify future generations? We could just not worry about it,
and basically walk away from the tram lever and let nature take its course.
