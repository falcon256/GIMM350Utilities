Order of operations when a solution isn't obvious:
1. Intellisense
2. See if my machine learning based code completion has anything similar to suggest and try that out.
3. Unity ECS examples, if they aren't out of date.
4. Unity documentation, if it isn't out of date.
5. Google what I'm trying to do, get no more than a bit of API reference and the return to step 1 without copy/pasting more than a method name.
6. I've literally never gotten past step 5, so if you get to this step: delete the project and move somewhere without internet.
